		<p><b>Inline Elements</b><br>An <em>Inline Element</em> does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
		<p><b>Block Elements</b><br>A <em>Block-Level Element</em> always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available stretches out to the left and right as far as it can</p>

		<b>How the Web Works</b>
<p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate
  with each other. When a person goes to a web
  page like www.google.com, their computer sends
  a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The
  server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
  it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em>
  interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.
